I would also like share my experience why I suddenly gained an interest in makeup. My interest grew in the start of the pandemic. All my sisters and I are under the same roof again because of the lockdown
that was imposed in the country. We started to have a stronger bond and we began to share our interest. My eldest sister shared her interest about makeup and I was suddenly awed by how beautiful the texture of
one of her cosmetics is. It's unlike any product I've touched before, it was so creamy and soft that you almost feel like you want to play with it. It is funny how a single object can make you really interested in
that certain field and how much you come to appreciate more things. I also came to realise how fast time is and how short our youthful times will last. I personally want to enjoy my teenager years to the fullest
and I was also inspired by a story of a woman in Europe. She was one of the oldest person who ever lived and she told her story and I was really touched about her thoughts. One of the most memorable line that she said is, "I am 80 years old but 40 years younger in heart." 
She showed how much she loved her youth and that brought me to appreciate my youthful times more.

Review: Skinimalism: Makeup And Skincare Merge In Issy & Co.’s New Active Skin Tint And Loose Powder
</h3>

<p>
Minimalism has really taken off since last year and it says so much about how we have reacted and adjusted to the global situation created by the pandemic. We’re aware of how the pandemic has impacted so many lives, how it has deprived many of the right to live and the opportunity to live well—and that translated, albeit maybe subconsciously, in the way we approach our everyday life.
</p>

<p>
In terms of design, minimalism is about finding beauty in simplicity. In terms of lifestyle, it’s about being more intentional about the things that you welcome in your life, so that you buy and own less things, but you <a href="https://metro.style/beauty/makeup/issy-co-active-skin-tint-and-loose-powder/29401">read more...</a>

Review: Maybelline Fit Me Concealer Review: Your New Go-To?
</h3>

<p>
The Maybelline Fit Me Concealer has been on my radar for years now (and probably yours, too, if you haven’t tried it yet). But for someone who works in the lifestyle publishing industry and often gets sent products to try, my relationship with makeup is quite conservative. So I only got to try it this year, after I’ve finished the ones that got sent to me. If, by some miracle, you’re late to the party like me, here’s my Maybelline Fit Me Concealer review to help you decide whether to pick it up or not.
</p>

<p>
The concealer comes in the usual tube with a doe-foot applicator. It has a no-nonsense feel to it, much like what the product claims to deliver. Take not <a href="https://madcherry.net/maybelline-fit-me-concealer-review/">read more...</a>

<h3>
My Review on ROMAND's Better than Finish Powder:
</h3>

<p>
This powder reduces the oiliness and sebum on your face to make your skin look fresh and clean for a longer time.
This product is very handy since it has a mirror, two applicators for the powder, and it is in a small container so you can easily carry it everywhere.
I would recommend this product to everyone since it did not cause any irritations and made my skin free from oil for over 7 hours with just one application.

Review: nnisfree Auto Eyebrow, Brow Master and Skinny Brow pencils – Cheap as chips!
</h3>

<p>
I recently shared my favourite brow pencil that I toted all the way back from Japan. It is one of the latest in a long line of brow pencils I’ve been going through over the years. Prior to that, I practically swore by the Chanel brow pencil and got my family members hooked on it too.
</p>

<p>
Then, I was told by a friend that Innisfree had a brow pencil similar to the Excel one, so I trotted off to the store to have a look. Well, I didn’t know that Innisfree had so many different types of brow pencils! So, in the interest of experimenting, I took a few home with me.

Review: An in-depth review of Issy & Co's new Brow Refiner (a brow tint + castor oil duo)I

<p>
Filipinos may love their lipsticks but eyebrow makeup is what they can’t live without! Having a nice pair of kilay is something of a national obsession, so it only makes sense that this would be the focus of Issy & Co’s newest release. ICYMI, this new Filipino brand recently broke into the local beauty scene with their vegan lipstick line in pretty, minimalist packaging. If you haven’t tried anything from them yet, I’m here to rave about their latest drop, the Brow Refiner!
</p>

<p>
This brow mascara instantly stands out because of its dual ended design: on one end is the brow gel to tint and tame brow hairs, while the other contains castor oil <a href="http://www.projectvanity.com/projectvanity/get-fuller-eyebrows-in-seconds-with-issy-cos-new-brow-refiner">read more...</a>

With 4.9 star ratings on Shopee, Perfect Diary High-definition Long-lasting Mascara should be on every girl’s list. It has two different shades, namely black and brown. If you’re going for a natural look, we suggest that you choose the black shade. Whereas the brown which is suitable for light skin tone is perfect if you want to attain a soft and feminine look. Formulated with carnauba wax, it helps to deliver a 3D lifting effect with just one usage.

Hello, people of the world! I am so excited for today's post because I will sharing my thoughts and opinions regarding this newly release eyeshadow palette from Focallure called the Hi Perth. They have released 4 Go Travel Palettes last month and I have never ordered something so fast in my entire life. I kid you not, I placed my order 22 minutes after they have posted these palettes on their Official Shopee Philippines Store. They have been posting a lot of updates on their official Instagram account and I was so amazed the first time I have laid my eyes upon this specific palette. Thus, my immediate order for this stunning palette.

Ever since the pandemic began, my sisters and I had more time to spend together
since we are all under the same roof once again brought by the reason of the lockdown. We started to share our interests
and talk about stories, one of the interests of one of my sister is cosmetics. We then watched a lot of beauty reviews and found this local product.
I really love this and it makes your lips look very moisturized and pretty. I'm a bit neutral toned so the shade Wondermelon is a perfect choice for you.

Review: Carmex Lip Balm Jar
</h3>

<p>
This lip balm is long-lasting, it protects my lips in the cold and in the wind, and makes them smooth. It leaves a thin layer, but that is all you need to protect your lips and moisturize them. I've already mentioned Carmex (stick) in a POST, but this time I bought the one in a jar. I carry the stick with me everywhere I go, and I use the jar at home.  Since I've met Carmex my lips are no longer dry and they're always in perfect condition. I heard about Carmex before, but only recently found it in croatian stores (Muller). Carmex is supposedly very good for cold sores, but because I've never had those, I can't say if it works or not.

For local brand BLK Cosmetic‘s 2nd anniversary, they released a limited edition lip gloss in a very beautiful rose gold shade.

So thrilled to share with you guys my review of it.

No, I’m definitely not done with singing the praises of Sunnies Face’s lip offering.

Colourette recently added nine more shades to the line with an improved formula and relaunched packaging so I was really excited to try these. Now at P349 each for 3.5ml of product (they used to be 3g), is it worth getting your <a href="http://www.projectvanity.com/projectvanity/swatches-review-the-new-colourette-velvetints">read more...</a>

Review: Review + Swatches: Is the Sunnies Face Fluffmatte Lipstick worth your money?
</h3>

<p>
Here's a fact of life: women don't buy lipstick because they need one. They buy because of the way it makes them feel. We tend to pick up our bullet of the day because of our mood or even according to who we want to be like; is it chic and elegant, sexy and hot, smart and practical? The permutations are endless, which is why lipstick is one of the easiest beauty products to sell even in an already crowded market. We can't have too much of it because we assign a unique and personal <a href="http://www.projectvanity.com/projectvanity/sunnies-face-fluffmatte-lipstick">read more...</a>

Review: Canmake Cream Cheek
</h3>

<p>
As you can tell, I’ve been buying more blushes than lipsticks (oh, the horror!) and let me tell you that blushes are strangely addictive, but I can’t figure out why either.
</p>

<p>
A few years ago, my friend A told me about these famous blushes from J-beauty brand Canmake, and it got me pretty interested back then, but I never got around to buying them until I saw them on discount in Taiwan.
</p>

<p>
This blush is said to be the top pick in Japanese and Taiwanese drugstores (I’ll talk a little more about why not Korean drugstores), so naturally I had to give this a shot and see if it really lives up to its hype.

Review: Sunnies Face Airblush Review
</h3>

<p>

Sunnies Face - you have been around for quite some time and I don't know why I didn't get to talk about you or try you!  So when I got the chance to shop at BeautyMNL, I took the effort to look for makeup products and brands that I really want to share to you my thoughts and of course, I picked for products you guys want me to talk about!
</p>

<p>
Housed in a cute compact packaging with the compact color similar as the blush color itself, I find this to be really nice and easy to spot! 
I picked the shade Biscuit for so many reason!  Biscuit is a warm nude shade according to the website but I find it to be a bit cool on my skin tone.  That said you really have to search online for reviewers with a similar skin tone as you to be able to really see <a href="http://www.askmewhats.com/2019/11/sunnies-face-airblush-review.html">read more...</a></p>

Review: We Tried This Pinay Beauty Vlogger’s P500 Brush Set
</h3>

<p>
When we heard that YouTuber Anne Clutz released a 10-piece makeup brush set for beginners priced at P500 for the whole thing, we knew we had to get our hands on them. When she launched the product a few weeks ago, everything sold out in minutes—which obviously made us even more curious about them.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, we were able to score a set and test them out firsthand. Being the makeup brush addict that I am, of course I volunteered to test them out. Here are my thoughts:
</p>

<p>
The set comes in a black canvas pouch (which means washing the pouch will be a breeze!)  All 10 brushes have pretty white handles and rose gold ferrules. As for the synthetic bristles, they were soft and fluffy AF—my teammates and I honestly couldn’t stop touching them. Here’s a closer look:
</p>

<p>
<b>First use:</b>
Let me be honest and say that I had my reservations about this set. I’ve always had a bias towards natural-haired brushes because I felt like they work better with my makeup routine. I use natural-haired brushes for my powders and my fingers for my liquids and creams.
</p>

<p>
But as with any beauty-obsessed girl, I’m always willing to try something new.
</p>

<p>
I first disinfected the set with a heavy-duty brush cleaner for my first use. I immediately fell in love with the round blush brush—as a foundation brush! It buffed out my base beautifully and the dense bristles left a natural and flawless finish. Another instant favorite was the flat angled kabuki brush, which, according to Anne’s posts, is intended to be a foundation brush, but I used it to apply and blend out my cream blush.
</p>

<p>
I used all the other brushes as part of my routine, but the two aforementioned brushes definitely stood out. They blended out my bases like a dream!
</p>

<p>
<b>Post-wash</b>
Deep-cleaning new brushes is always nerve-racking, because you never know if you’ll end up losing half the bristles after just one wash. Luckily, that didn’t happen with this set. There was no fallout even with my semi-intense cleaning (I take deep-cleaning very seriously!) I used baby shampoo and a brush-cleaning mat to get rid of all the dirt and gunk. All the liquids and creams were easily removed, even from the most dense face brushes. Also, none of the brushes were left stained, and the bristles <a href="https://www.cosmo.ph/beauty/makeup/anne-clutz-makeup-brushes-review-a1085-a1027-20180220">read more...</a>
