<p>
Coraline is a stop-motion film that was released in the year 2009. This is my favorite movie of all time and the details in the design and storyline would make you hooked.
As of now, I've probably rewatched this movie more than 50 or 60 times since the year 2010 and everytime I watch it, I realise how much of a classin this film is.

<p>
I would define The Lovely Bones as a very saddening story about a normal cheerful girl living her life at the fullest while curiosity gets the best out of her. This is actually the only movie that made me cry.
You would realise and appreciate so many things after watching this movie. This film will bring youu feelings of sadness and happiness. It is worth a watch.

<p> First of all, I am a hardcore or semi-hardcore Potterhead. Ever since the year 2011, I have watched some movies of the Harry Potter series and was fascinated by the interesting concept and plotline of the story.
For me, the 5th movie is the best one out of all eight. In this movie, the part of the story is slowely climbing to the climax and it is very satisfying and fun to watch. So don't miss out to watch this movie.

chemistry as actors and you would say that they themselves are like the characters of the book in real life. This movie became not disappointing because of these two, so what are you waiting for? Watch the movie on Netflix!

you laugh like there's no tomorrow. Though I will warn you, there are quite some crude words in this movie.  The comedic scenes or parts of this movie is one of the most fun things to watch and you won't be dissapointed one bit.

<p>If you are a person who is really close to me, you can easily agree that I'm a bitter person. However. this K-drama didn't fail to make my heart skip or flutter every episode. The actress who played the role of the main character nailed everything, her actions, habit, voice, facial expressions, and etc. defined
herself as the main character and ONE of my most favorite character of all the shows, movies, and books I read. This is a rom-com, though, just a small spoiler, some scenes may make your heart ache but finishing this drama is like a good adventure.Fun fact! This K-Drama is based on a webtoon.

 <p>
This is totally one of the best series I can recommend you. All of the cast play their given roles or characters so perfectly that you can see how immersed they are and how natural they act. The thrill and cinematography of this series is just stunning and perfect. I have never liked such a thriller series in my life ever.
And, I can say that this drama depicts some aspects of current political problems being experienced by the country or the world. So, this somehow gives us a bit more idea of the behavior of the people around us.
Currently, I am waiting for the third season and I would really like you to give it a watch and see what you think.

<h3>
Kingdom Feels Like a Nightmare of Now
</h3>

 <p>
Picture a nation already gripped by political chaos that finds itself afflicted by a plague so new that no one understands its properties yet. Its ruler is a demented senior whose underlings use his decline as camouflage for their own agendas. As citizens turn against each other, medical experts operating on the scientific method study the pandemic and present their latest findings to officials at every layer of government. They are met with indifference, stupidity, naked self-interest, and craven pandering to higher-ups. Things keep getting worse. The body count rises. There‚Äôs no end in sight.
</p>

<p>
This is the world of Kingdom, an engrossing South Korean zombie series set in the 16th century. Watching its 12-episode, two-season run right now is an eerie experience, because although it started shooting in 2017 and debuted on Netflix last January, it seems to have predicted the future. On top of being a fast-paced horror epic in historical garb, Kingdom mirrors the disastrous mishandling of the 2020 pandemic (particularly in the United States) with such withering irony and pitch-black humor that it seems to be riffing on headlines you read five minutes ago.
</p>

<!--Seitz, M. Z. (2020, July 9). Kingdom Feels Like a Nightmare of Now. VULTURE. https://www.vulture.com/article/kingdom-netflix-review.html -->

<p>Written by Kim Eun-hee and directed by Kim Seong-hun and Park In-je, Kingdom starts in the royal palace at night. An underling is commanded to slip a bowl of blood through the crack under the red curtain of the king‚Äôs sleeping quarters. We hear guttural grows and animalistic shuffling and scratching. Then the underling gets yanked under the curtain by the king, who has become a flesh-eating ghoul subsisting on servants and peasants. We soon learn that the king‚Äôs inner circle has been keeping his condition a secret and presenting their own schemes as the king‚Äôs wishes.The main focus of their treachery is Crown Prince Lee Chang (Ju Ji-hoon), the king‚Äôs son and anointed successor. The Queen Consort (Kim Hye-jun) is pregnant with the king‚Äôs child; if the prince gets whacked or imprisoned, her baby will assume the throne and allow her and the traitorous Chief State Councilor (Ryu Seung-ryong) to run things on the infant‚Äôs behalf.
</p>

<p>The prince and his bodyguard Mu-yeong (Kim Sang-ho) travel to a remote province to investigate reports of a strange disease that‚Äôs been spreading at the border, and meet two physicians, Seo-Bi (Bae Doona) and Yeong-Shin (Kim Sung-kyu), who have been researching a phenomenon that they identify <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/kingdom-netflix-review.html">(Read more)</a>

Locke & Key: Season 1 ‚Äì Netflix Series Review
</h3>

<p>Locke & Key is a new Netflix horror series that also has a lot of fantasy elements. In some amazing ways. It‚Äôs based on the comic book series by horror author Joe Hill and illustrator Gabriel Rodriguez. I have not read these, but from what I gather, fans of the graphic novels might find this adaptation too light.
</p>

<p>However, season 1 of this Netflix series does have some very dark moments. The two last episodes are generally very horror-filled, which might have a lot to do with who directed them. More on that in our final segment of this review.<a href="https://www.heavenofhorror.com/reviews/locke-key-season-1-netflix-series-review/">(Read more.)</a>

<p>
Attack On Titan is a masterpiece. I won't say this is an opinion, but for me, it is a FACT. This anime series has one of the most creative author who gives one of the best plotlines and plotwists I've encountered in all
the movies and shows I've watched in my 15 years of existence. A story where mankind was living inside the walls, hiding from these monstrous creatures who are called "Titans". Creatures who have the instict to attack and eat 
the person in front of them without stopping. But, a child named Eren will change the fate of the people inside the walls to achieve freedom.

This is a perfect movie to watch whenever you want to relax. The animation, color schemes, characters, ideas, dialogue, or in short, everything is perfect in this movie.
You will feel your heart flutter and have fun while watching all the scenes in the movie. The story started when a girl named Sophie was going outside and encountered two strange men
who started to make her feel uncomfortable. THEN, the man who will change Sophie's life came to rescue her and then, the story starts to unfold.

<p>This anime has a really friendly comedy compared to other anime shows(BNHA Grape boy I hate you with a passion). One of the best things this anime showcased in the show is that they game each class member an episode of their own or
they really give emphasize what that specific character is good at. This anime was not only focused on the character development of the protagonist, but also, the character development of all of the protagonist's classmates. It is 
an anime where you will truly appreciate the friendship between classmate to classmate and teacher to teacher.

<p>Ouran High School Host Club is an anime consisting of 24 episodes. This is a very funny anime and it is categorized as a shoujo manga. Now, I won't say that almost all the girls in shoujo manga are spineless, but many of them are.
BUT, HARUHI ISN'T LIKE THAT. The manin character's name is Haruhi and in the beginning of the first episode, she made her appearance by climbing up a grand staircas in a very grand building. Haruhi looked like a very dishelved person and she entered one of
the rooms and she was surprised to find out that the room was not actually their school library. In fact, she entered the room containing a school club that will change her life.

Manga Review: WHY YOU NEED TO READ THE HORROR MASTERPIECE UZUMAKI
</h3>
<p>
Last week, we learned that Adult Swim would be producing an anime miniseries based on horror manga legend Junji Ito‚Äôs Uzumaki. The teaser looked like Ito‚Äôs startling drawings come to life which made us very excited for the anime next year. But if you‚Äôve never read‚Äîor even heard of‚ÄîUzumaki, you may not understand why it‚Äôs such an important work. Something of the Watchmen of horror manga, Uzumaki combines Ito‚Äôs penchant for disgusting body horror, the perversion of ordinary life, and massive cosmic phenomena. It‚Äôs the most perfect epic of its creator‚Äôs psyche. And here‚Äôs why you should read it.

Uzumaki is Japanese for ‚Äúspiral,‚Äù the crux of the entire piece. Ito originally wrote the story for the serialized publication Big Spirit Comics between 1998 and 1999. The story, as many Ito stories do<a href="https://nerdist.com/article/uzumaki-junji-ito-horror-why-you-should-read/"> read more...</a>

<h3>
Manga Review: Why You Should Read Jujutsu Kaisen (Manga)
</h3>

<p>
Alongside Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Jujutsu Kaisen is the biggest name in shounen manga and anime right now. Many, myself included, have praised it for revitalising the shounen space and ushering in a new age of shounen.
</p>

<p>
When you watch or read Jujutsu Kaisen, you‚Äôre experiencing something wholly new; something that wears its inspiration on its sleeve (we‚Äôll get to that), but also uses fresh eyes to tell an original and groundbreaking shounen story.
</p>

<p>
If you‚Äôve already watched the anime, should you also read Jujutsu Kaisen? Or, if you haven‚Äôt seen it, is the Jujutsu Kaisen manga the best place to start enjoying the series? Let‚Äôs dig into both of these <a href="https://booksandbao.com/why-you-should-read-jujutsu-kaisen-manga/">read more...</a>

Manhwa Review: Your Throne
</h3>

<p>
To be quite honest, I really was not expecting myself to like this manhwa as much as I did. I think I started reading it right before it became serialized on Webtoon, and thought that it would be a typical revenge plot where Medea would try to earn back the Crown Prince‚Äôs love. But long behold, after reading more into the story, the plot thickens and it no longer became just about one MC, but two very different but similar MCs. I‚Äôd say if you dropped this manhwa‚Ä¶please rethink and try to power through the first 10 chapters, and the rest will be very juicy in terms of story and characters.
</p>

<p>
<b>Plot:</b> I really quite enjoyed the story. I feel like the plot is always leading me to new conclusions and ideas. I feel like I‚Äôm always trying to churn my brain. Someone commented once that the moment you think you understand what Medea‚Äôs up to, she‚Äôs actually 5 steps ahead of you. There‚Äôs just so many surprises, and I think I‚Äôm always <a href="https://royalteagarden.wordpress.com/2021/03/10/manhwa-review-your-throne/">read more...</a>

Manhwa Review: Who Made Me A Princess
</h3>

<p>
One of my first many Otome based isekai I‚Äôve read and loved. I absolutely adore the art direction this series has, the characters and the surrounding background are gorgeous. The story starts off with Athanasia waking up as a small infant. Carrying memories of her past-life, she is reincarnating as the Unloved Princess in the romance novel titled ‚ÄòThe Lovely Princess.‚Äô Having knowledge that she will be executed in the future, she searches for ways to defy fate. As she grows up, our little Princess will try to win his Majesty‚Äôs favor, befriending a mysterious boy named Lucas, and the son of a Duke named Ijekiel.
</p>

<p>
Our little Princess isn‚Äôt the typical dumb girl, she is comedic and very smart for the decisions she‚Äôs made thus far. A bit of an airhead when it comes to romance, but her full attention goes towards her ‚ÄòDaddy‚Äô and that‚Äôs really the only fluff we <a href="https://royalteagarden.wordpress.com/2020/04/16/manhwa-review-who-made-me-a-princess/">read more...</a>
