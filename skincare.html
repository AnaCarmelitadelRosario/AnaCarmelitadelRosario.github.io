What is Skin Care?
</h1>
<hr/>

<p>
Skin Care is a practice where you cleanse, tone, moisturize, and etc. your skin 
to keep it healthy and clean. The suitable skin care for your skin can help it make look
glowing, moisturize, clean, and beautiful.</p>

<hr/>
<h2>According to Skin Center of South Miami, good skin care is important because:
</h2>
<hr/>
<p>
<p><b>It helps your skin stay in good condition:</b> You’re shedding skin cells throughout the day, so it’s important to keep your skin glowing and in good condition. An effective routine can help prevent acne, treat wrinkles, and help keep your skin looking its best.
</p>

<p><b>Your skin will look more youthful:</b> As you age, your skin’s cells turn over more slowly, make it look duller and less radiant. Using a quality skin care line can help remove dead skin cells so your body will replace them with newer, more youthful cells.
</p>

<p><b>Prevention is easier than correction:</b> Preventing skin problems is easier -– and less costly – than trying to fix them in the future. 
</p>

<p><b>Your self-confidence will get a boost:</b> When your skin looks better, you’ll feel better about yourself and have more self-confidence.

<h3>CLEANSER</h3>

<p>
In the morning, start by splashing your face with warm water or, if you must, wash with a gentle face cleanser designed for your skin type.
</p>

</div>

<div id="step2">
<img src="https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/p403x403/251030518_296834818781026_2659670020502513236_n.png?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=aee45a&_nc_ohc=IOpFdJoyTLMAX8WdkDm&_nc_ad=z-m&_nc_cid=0&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=72ac2c54f685744a589dbf90d42f7289&oe=61A65E71" alt="Step 2 daytime logo" width="75" height="75" class="center"/>
<h3>TONER</h3>

<p>Most people choose to skip toners, partly because there’s a lingering assumption that most toners are harsh and irritate the skin. Fortunately, that’s not the case anymore. While they don’t physically “shrink” pores, the new breed of toners can serve multiple purposes, like act as a delivery system for antioxidants, vitamin-B derivatives and even toning acids. Additionally, each type of toner is intended for a different skin issue, so it’s important to use the right kind for your skin concern.</p>

<p>However, if you have lived all your life without using a toner and your skin looks healthy, Dr. Rogers says there is no need to start using one. “Toners were created to help return the skin’s pH after it became too basic from harsh soaps,” explains Dr. Rogers. “Face cleansers are now so much better balanced that toners are not a required step for me.” That said, if you have a toner that you like using, there’s no harm in sticking with it.</p>

<h3>ANTIOXIDANT SERUM</h3>
<p>Serums are super-concentrated, nutrient-dense treatments that address specific concerns, so it’s better to keep them as close to the skin as possible. There are various serums available on the market today, but for daytime, Dr. Rogers recommends antioxidant serums, which provide a variety of benefits—from blunting your skin’s inflammatory response to neutralizing damage from UV rays and environmental pollutants.</p>

<h3>EYE CREAM
</h3>

<p>According to Dr. Annie Chiu, a board-certified dermatologist, it’s vital to apply an eye cream at least every night—if not twice a day—starting in your 20s. “It’s about maintaining the health and thickness of the eyelid skin. Improving the skin quality in this area early on ensures that the eyelid skin does not easily lose laxity and its smooth appearance later on.”</p>

<p>For best results, consistency is key. “Regular use of eye cream over time will keep the eyelid skin elastic and can improve or prevent against some fine lines or collagen loss. Remember: Nothing is magic. Results don’t occur overnight,” Dr. Chiu adds. “You can further protect the delicate skin around your eyes by choosing an eye cream with SPF or applying sunscreen every day.” Dr. Chiu also advises people to remember to wear sunglasses when outside to protect against UV-light damage and lines that can creep up around the corners of your eyes from squinting.

<h3>SPOT TREATMENT</h3>

<p>According to Dr. Diane De Fiori, a dermatologist at Rosacea Treatment Clinic, prescription medications and acne spot treatments need to be applied as close to the skin as possible to maximize their benefits.
</p>
<p>As acne spot treatments differ in active ingredients, check your product packaging or consult your dermatologist for the best way to apply it. Prescription-strength benzoyl peroxide, a common acne spot-treatment ingredient, has a one-to-three-hour working time, according to esthetician and acne specialist Ashley Wiley. “Any cream that comes in contact with it before it has completed its work will likely inhibit the active ingredient from working properly.”
</p>
<p>Remember that acne spot treatments can dry out your skin, so always apply only on spots where you need it.
</p>
</div>

<div id="step6">
<img src="https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/p403x403/249849447_1576003722754152_7396115563008795546_n.png?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=aee45a&_nc_ohc=u83-srg9uLYAX9hdEe3&_nc_ad=z-m&_nc_cid=0&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=bd03031e8ca391aaf1995facb3cfb68b&oe=61A6559D" alt="Step 6 daytime logo" width="75" height="75" class="center"/>
<h3>MOISTURIZER</h3>

<p>Yes, everyone needs a moisturizer, even if you have oily skin. “Even though your body has its own natural lubricating system consisting of glands that secrete oil (or sebum) to maintain a protective coating against harsh outside conditions and infections, most of us do need extra hydration after the havoc that sun, weather and harsh chemicals wreak on our skin,” explains Dr. Sandra Kopp, a board-certified dermatologist.
</p>
<p>Most experts recommend that the best time to apply a moisturizer is while the skin is still damp, so the sooner you go through applying your serum and treatment, the sooner you’re able to lock in much-needed hydration with your moisturizer.
</p>
<p>If you’re using an acne spot treatment, you may want to skip those areas when applying your moisturizer to make sure the ingredients in it won’t interfere with the active ingredients in your spot treatment.
</p>
</div>

<div id="step7">
<img src="https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/p403x403/249993513_427558612100496_342187456550409668_n.png?_nc_cat=110&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=aee45a&_nc_ohc=nKa3-mxUdukAX8gWJW0&_nc_ad=z-m&_nc_cid=0&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=b87164541edea316f2b5f5761b7b1f0c&oe=61A5AB80" alt="Step 7 daytime logo" width="75" height="75" class="center"/>
<h3>SUNCREEN</h3>

<p>Sunscreen should be the last step in your daytime skin care routine if you’re using a physical or mineral sunscreen, which works by physically blocking UV rays. This step becomes tricky when you’re using a chemical sunscreen.
</p>
<p>Dr. Rogers explains: “Chemical sunscreens have to be absorbed into the skin to be effective, so applying after your moisturizer will delay and hinder that. However, if you apply your chemical sunscreen before your moisturizer, your moisturizer will not work as well either because the skin is coated with chemical sunscreen.”
</p>
<p>To get around this, Dr. Rogers recommends using a physical sunscreen with zinc and to apply it after your moisturizer. “Zinc is safe, effective and provides the broadest protection against UVA and UVB rays.”
</p>
<p>As for those who like using chemical sunscreens, try to look for a formula that offers moisturizing benefits, so you can get your daily hydration needs while protecting your skin.

<h3>(DOUBLE) CLEANSER</h3>
<p>To get rid of the day’s grime, dirt, oil and makeup, some experts recommend removing your makeup first with a dedicated makeup remover before washing your face with a gentle cleanser. Better yet, try double cleansing, which involves using a cleansing oil first to dissolve your makeup and then washing your face again with your regular cleanser.
</p>
</div>

<h3>TONERS, ESSENCES AND BOOSTERS</h3>
<p>If you use a toner, apply it as you would in the morning.
</p>
<p>At night, some people also like to layer various types of skin care boosters, which you’ll see as either mists, essences, beauty waters or hydrating (hyaluronic acid) serums. These are infused with different active ingredients, but for the most part, the purpose is mainly to hydrate and nourish skin.
</p>
<p>Since these are lightweight, almost water-like formulas; apply them after washing your face as you would a toner. “If using both, apply toner then essence,” says Dr. Rogers. “Toner is more to clean and essence is more about delivering a treatment.” If using multiple boosters, the same rules apply: apply from thinnest to thickest.
</p>

<h3>EYE CREAM</h3>
<p>Aside from addressing crow’s feet and dark circles, eye creams can also serve to protect your delicate eye area from your other skin care products.
</p>
<p>“Generally, you’d want to apply your eye cream before your treatments to protect your eye area against potent ingredients, which could potentially cause irritation,” according to Dr. Rogers.
</p>
</div>

<div id="n4">

<h3>TREATMENTS, SERUMS AND PEELS</h3>
<p>Like the rest of the body, skin does the bulk of its repairing, restoring and regenerating as we sleep. This is why most targeted skin care treatments—like prescription meds (tretinoin, acne and rosacea creams), retinol creams, exfoliating treatments (peel pads and masks) and anti-aging serums (infused with peptides, growth factors and other biologically active ingredients)—are better used at night. However, instead of layering up all your treatment serums and creams, Dr. Rogers suggests choosing your evening treatment depending on your skin’s of-the-moment needs.
</p>
<p>“Too many steps just increase the risk of irritation and decrease the likelihood of the desired result,” says Dr. Rogers. “Pick your evening treatment based on what your skin needs that night, not based on what you have in your medicine cabinet. Some nights, it may be just wash, moisturize and bed. There is always tomorrow to give your skin more love.”
</p>

<h3>MOISTURIZER OR NIGHT CREAM</h3>
<p>Some people use the same moisturizer for day and night. However, night moisturizers or night creams are generally thicker and heavier and designed to be absorbed over the course of several hours.
</p>
<p>“Moisturizer, particularly the heavier ones used at night, create a protective coating on the skin to prevent water evaporation while you sleep,” says Dr. Rogers. “Maintaining a high water content in the skin is key for healing and maintaining healthy skin. If you are using the right moisturizer, it should be your last step because nothing is going to get through it.” If your skin is on the dry side, you may want to add a face oil before applying your night cream.

<h3>CLEANSER</h3>

<p> Since my skin type is normal to oily. I use Nivea Acne Clear Whip Foam. I've been using this for 
the past two years and this provided my skin a soft feel to it. It also didn't irritate me but I think this will 
irritate people with dry skin because my younger sister, whose skin type is dry, used this and developed some 
small pimple. Nevertheless, this product is great for people with the same skin type as me and it is also cheap.

<h3>CLAY MASK</h3>
<p>
The exfoliating mask I use is Innisfree's Super Volcanic Pore Clay Mask 2x. I use this once a week
to exfoliate all the dirt and dead skin. I bought this last Christmas and I still am using this so this
is a long term product. You will put this on your face for about 10 - 15 minutes and wash it off. This product isn't harsh to the skin and would probably 
fit all skin types since I am sharing this with my younger sister, the one with the dry skin type, and the results on her are good too.
This removed all my blackheads well and visibly brightens my skin in every use.
I would rate this product a 5/5.

<h3>EYE MASK</h3>

<p>
In the end of the School Year 2020-2021, my interest in eye masks suddenly peaked. I was always sleeping late during that time and I've noticed dark circles under my eyes
and became self-concious. I searched the Internet to look for products that will lessen or lighten the darkness under my eyes. Luckily, I found this product named Heimish Bulgarian Rose Water Hydrogel Eye Patch
and was intrigued almost immediately. Before purchasing the product, I had a lot of debate with myself. Questions like, "Will this be worth my money?" "Will this even work on me though?" Arised. These questions bothered me
because I had a past experience with eye creams. The product I bought was disappointing, it didn't even give a slight change on the darkness under my eyes. I was simply scared to be disappointed but I still took the risk to buy the product.
Fortunately, I was not disappointed, this product is now one of my most favorite ones and it smell is amazing;but, not overpowering. I use this once a week and let it sit
under my eyes for 30 minutes, however, I haven't had enough time nowadays but the effect per use is still astonishing. The swollen part under your eye will be gone the morning you wake up
and your dark circles will become lighter. You can also apply this product on any part of your face and it is water soluble so you can mix it with warm water and transform it into a brightening serum.

<h3>ESSENCE</h3>
<p>
Next product I use daily is Illiyoon Probiotics Skin Barrier Essence Drop. I bought mine in early January this year
in a cute small 20mL bottle in Shopee. I was looking for a product that would give my skin a better look and a better feel and
I came across this one while searching the web. This product helps the skin to repair its skin barrier so that the oiliness will
be less and the skin won't be dry. It also helps in calming the red spots on your face and I actually saw this effect after 3 weeks.
I won't say it works like magic like the eye mask and this product is an OK for me. I think I would look for a better essence and I will
rate this product a 3.5/5.

<h3>SERUM</h3>
<p>
After applying essence, I apply a serum called COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence/Serum. Now, when you look this up on the Internet
you would see tons of reviews about how great this product is and I agree with them. This is one of the most promising skin care product I used and it works like magic.
The serum is 96% snail mucin, which is the liquid snails leave in a trail. This may sound quite odd to others but the snail mucin works best in moisturizing, healing, and making the skin look youthful at all times.
This product is great for all skin types and I've never experienced any bad effect with this product. Rest assured, this product was made in a process where the animals weren't harmed.
Overall, this product can easily get a 5/5 from me by providing me its effects which I enjoy greatly until today.

<h3>MOISTURIZER</h3>
<p>
Finally, we have arrived at my last step, the moisturizer. The product I am currently using is Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream. They said that this is one of the best moisturizers the Korean market can give you.
However, that is not my case. Although I am still using this, I wouldn't repurchase this. People said that it can work on any skin type but it didn't in my case. This makes my skin feel slightly heavy and super oily.
I would recommend this to poeple with dry skin. I could also say that this can work for some people with the same skin type as me, however, that person must use it in a cold night or in a cold place to prevent oiliness to appear.
Overall, this product wasn't for me.
