<p><i>Locke & Key</i> is a TV Show in Netflix that shows a very dark and intriguing concepts and ideas.</p>
<p>I've enjoyed watching this TV show on Netflix because of how interesting and peculiar the concept was.
I remember watching this series with my sisters last year and this show became one of the factors that strengthened our relationship.
The thrill and excitement I feel whenever a characteristic of a key is being presented per episode is one of the best feelings I got to
experience...</p>

I started to have an interest with cosmetics in the middle of the year 2020.
</p>
<p>
Ever since the pandemic began, my sisters and I had more time to spend together
since we are all under the same roof once again brought by the reason of the lockdown. We started to share our interests
and talk about stories, one of the interests of one of my sister is cosmetics...

<h2>
My Fancy Looking and Effective Eye Mask</h2>

<p>
In the end of the School Year 2020-2021, my interest in eye masks suddenly peaked. I was always sleeping late during that time and I've noticed dark circles under my eyes
and became self-concious. I searched the Internet to look for products that will lessen or lighten the darkness under my eyes. Luckily, I found this product named Heimish Bulgarian Rose Water Hydrogel Eye Patch
and was intrigued almost immediately. Before purchasing the product, I had a lot of debate with myself. Questions like, "Will this be worth my money?" "Will this even work on me though?" Arised. These questions bothered me
because I had a past experience with eye creams. The product I bought was disappointing, it didn't even give a slight change on the darkness under my eyes. I was simply scared to be disappointed but I still took the risk to buy the product.
Fortunately, I was not disappointed, this product is now one of my most favorite ones and it smell is amazing;but, not overpowering. I use this once a week and let it sit
under my eyes for 30 minutes, however, I haven't had enough time nowadays but the effect per use is still astonishing. The swollen part under your eye will be gone the morning you wake up
and your dark circles will become lighter. You can also apply this product on any part of your face and it is water soluble so you can mix it with warm water and transform it into a brightening serum.
